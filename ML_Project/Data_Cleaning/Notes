.Menu Driven system
.Can Check is it possible to ffill or bfill column or row wise due to mixed dataypes
.Can search all row containg target value
like searching mr will search both data "Mr Prince" and "Mr Baary"
“I validate column selection, datatype, and search input, and distinguish between empty results and invalid input.”
.Can Group Duplicate Data by its value. like We can display 2 gorups of dataframe on basis of survived:0 or survived:1
helps to dividing dataframe into groups on basis of same value it contains. 
.Its also in our hand to decide on which column Duplicate value should group by
“I identify duplicates using groupby-filter and present them group-wise, which improves interpretability over flat duplicate lists.” 


I detect outliers using the IQR method and provide multiple handling strategies like removal, capping, and median replacement, allowing safe and user-controlled preprocessing.”

“I implemented a menu-driven visualization system with strict datatype validation, column-count checks, and safe exception handling to ensure robust plotting for any uploaded dataset.”

“I implemented optional plot saving and multi-column visualization with datatype validation to ensure flexible and safe exploratory analysis.”

“I added theme selection, automatic legends, and standardized plot styling to make visualizations both user-friendly and presentation-ready.”

“I built a robust, menu-driven visualization engine with datatype validation, multi-plot support, theming, and safe exception handling for any dataset.”
